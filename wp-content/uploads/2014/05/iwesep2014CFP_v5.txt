CALL FOR PAPERS - IWESEP 2014

The 6th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice
  Nov. 12 - 13, 2014 
  Osaka, Japan 
  http://iwesep2014.naist.jp/

  Co-located with IPSJ SIGSE
*****************************************************************************
The objective of the 6th International Workshop on Empirical Software 
Engineering in Practice (IWESEP) is to foster the development of the 
area by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can 
report on and discuss new research results and applications in the 
area of empirical software engineering. The workshop encourages the 
exchange of ideas within the international community so as to be able 
to understand, from an empirical viewpoint, the strengths and weaknesses 
of technology in use and new technologies, with the expectation of 
furthering the more generic field of software engineering.

The workshop focuses on the processes, design and structure of empirical 
studies as well as the results of specific studies. These studies may be 
on original or replicated studies, varying from controlled experiments to 
field studies, from quantitative to qualitative. We solicit the following 
two types of submissions: full research papers (max 6 pages) for oral 
presentations and fast abstracts (max 700 words) for poster presentations. 
Please check the website for more information.

Accepted papers will be submitted to the IEEE Computer Society Digital 
Library and IEEE Xplore.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Empirical studies of software process and product
 - Comparison of cost estimation techniques
 - Analysis of the effects of design methods and characteristics
 - Evaluation of the readability of coding styles
 - Development, derivation and/or comparison of organizational models of
   software development
 - Evaluation of testing methodologies
 - Reports on the benefits derived from using development environments
 - Development of predictive models reliability from real data
 - Infrastructure issues, such as measurement theory, experimental design,
   qualitative modeling and analysis approaches
 - Experiences with research methods such as grounded theory, protocol
   studies or families of experiments
 - Industrial experience in process improvement
 - Quality measurement
 - Process modeling and applications in industry
 - Experience management
